# Capstone Starter Project

## Database 

Each of the SQL scripts has a specific purpose as described below:

| File Name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- | 
| `data.sql` | This script is used to populate the database with any static setup data or test/demo data. This script is intended to be modified by the project team. |
| `schema.sql` | This script is used to create all of the database objects (e.g. tables and sequences). This script is intended to be modified by the project team |

## JQuery and Bootstrap

Minified versions of the JQuery Core and Validation libraries (including the "Additional Methods" library) have been included in the `<project-root>/src/main/webapp/js/` directory.

Minified versions of the Bootstrap CSS and Javascript files have been included  in the `<project-root>/src/main/webapp/css/` and `<project-root>/src/main/webapp/js/` directories respectively.

## Ninject

Ninject has been added so that you can bind the application to support dependency injection.

## Deployment

You need to have the application deployed so that it is running off of a public facing internet site. You can deploy to AppHarbor 
(as we did in class). It is recommended that you set up the deployment at the beginning of the project.
